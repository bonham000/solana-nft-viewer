Sunday January 30, 2020:
4pm - 8pm (4 hours)
- Initial repo setup + basic project structure
- Create basic routing and component structure
- Setup dev-tooling (Prettier, ESLint, Jest, CI/CD, etc.)
- Deploy project using Surge.sh
- Read Metaplex Docs and other Solana accounts documentation
- Dig around solana/web3.js to figure out how to fetch transaction history for an address
- Dig around Magic Eden and try to figure out how to stitch together activity history for a mint address
- Piece together potential solution:
  1. Use mint address history to collect owner addresses from transfer transactions
  2. View each owner transaction history and find any transactions involving that mint and the Magic Eden program address
  3. Combine the above for a full activity history
  4. Figure out some way too parse the Magic Eden transactions...? Probably a hacky workaround?
